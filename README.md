A very simple to-do-list website

The website's main goal is to provide a very simple planning tool.
Users do not need to sign up or login to the website and write just one short activity a day.

There are two main functionalities:
1. Make
   Which is making a plan for or an activity record of:
   a. _today_,
   b. _yesterday_, and
   c. _tomorrow_
   By entering details of the above three fields (each 160 chars max.), as well as entering:
   d. _date_, and
   e. _initial_.
2. Show
   Which is showing the recorded "Make".
   Users can only show the plan if previously have made one.
   They can retrieve the record by submitting two keys: _initial_ and _date_. The website will throw an error message if any of the key is not accurate.
